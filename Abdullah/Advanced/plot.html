                    <p class="text-justify text-white">
                        Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher, learns he has terminal lung cancer. Desperate to secure the financial future of his family — his wife Skyler White is pregnant, his son Walter White Jr. has cerebral palsy — the 50-year-old leaves his second job at the car wash and teams up with a former student named Jesse Pinkman to make and sell meth. "You know the business. I know the chemistry," he tells his new partner, who declares Walt "a damn artist" after sampling the first batch cooked in their mobile-drug-lab.
                        Jesse takes said sample to Krazy-8, cousin to Jesse's recently busted drug-dealing partner Emilio Koyama. Emilio, out on bail and convinced Jesse ratted him out, sets up a double-cross. When a desert rendezvous with all four turns nasty, Walt creates a chemical explosion that leaves Emilio dead and Krazy-8 struggling to survive ("Pilot").
                        Krazy-8 escapes only to have Walt recapture him then lock him to a pole in Jesse's basement. Jesse and Walt then flip a coin to determine who'll dissolve Emilio's body in acid (Jesse's job) and who'll kill Krazy-8 (Walt's job). Skyler, meanwhile, uses *69 to trace a suspicious call from Jesse. When Skyler asks who the caller was, Walt says that Jesse is his pot dealer.
                        Skyler visits Jesse to tell him to stop selling her husband marijuana. After she leaves, Jesse gets to work on dis-incorporating Emilio's body. Because he ignores Walt's specific instructions to use a polyethylene plastic container, opting instead to pour hydrofluoric acid on Emilio in the bathtub, the acid completely eats through the tub, which collapses to the floor below leaving Walt and Jesse with a bloody mess to clean up ("Cat's in the Bag...").
                        At Walt's house, Skyler poses vague questions about marijuana to her sister Marie Schrader, who jumps to the conclusion that they're discussing Walter Jr., despite Skyler's denials. Shortly thereafter, Marie persuades her husband, Hank Schrader, a DEA agent, to scare the boy straight. Marie is breaking the law herself, however, having stolen a pair of shoes from a store where she felt the sales clerk was ignoring her.

                        In another part of town, Jesse bolts from his house after Walt berates him for divulging personal information to Krazy-8. Walt says they have more work to do, but Jesse begs to differ: "Coin flip is sacred! Your job is waiting for you in the basement." A heart-to-heart with Walt leaves Krazy-8 self-assured that Walt will spare him, but when Walt realizes Krazy-8 is conning him, he strangles the dealer. After disposing of the body, Walt gets back home and finally reveals to Skyler that he has cancer ("...and the Bag's in the River").
                        At a family barbecue, Walt reveals his illness to Marie, Hank, and Walter Jr. Walt balks at spending $5,000 to see a renowned oncologist. Walter Jr., frustrated by his dad's lack of emotion, blurts out, "Then why don't you just fucking die already?" Walt relents, using drug profits to pay the bill.
                        Jesse, haunted by recent events, flees to his parents' house. There, the maid discovers a joint. Jesse denies it's his, but his parents kick him out. As he leaves, his younger brother, Jake Pinkman, thanks Jesse for not telling on him ("Cancer Man").

                        At a birthday party at his fancy home, Elliott Schwartz, Walt's Nobel-prize winning former colleague, offers Walt employment, saying his company provides excellent health insurance. Walt declines the offer, later accusing Skyler of putting Elliott up to it.
                        Jesse attempts to cook meth but can't match Walt's quality. At a family pow-wow about Walt's cancer, Walt tells everyone, "All I have left is how I choose to approach (having cancer)"; he chooses not to have chemo. The next morning, though, he says he'll accept treatment and Elliott's help with it.
                        At a chemotherapy clinic, Walt tells Skyler he's taking Elliott's money but in fact, he's using the drug-dealing profits. His chemo bills mounting, Walt reunites with Jesse and tells him that they need to sell meth in bulk ("Gray Matter").
                        Having discovered a gas mask (labeled property of Walt's high school) in the desert, Hank inventories the storage room of Walt's chemistry lab and concludes that "some meth monkey had a feeding frenzy" there.
                        Jesse finagles an interview with Tuco Salamanca, Krazy-8's "badass" replacement as a distributor. Tuco loves Walt's meth but refuses to pay for it up front, beating up Jesse and swiping the meth. Walt returns to face down Tuco, using the identity of "Heisenberg," deceiving him with what looks like meth, but which is actually fulminated mercury that Walt uses to demolish Tuco's office. "You got balls," Tuco allows, and they make a deal for more meth ("Crazy Handful of Nothin'").
                        Jesse becomes outraged upon learning that Walt is doing business with Tuco. Things turn tenser still when Walt can't deliver Tuco's meth order in time. Walt talks Tuco into a loan, albeit at high interest, so that he and Jesse can procure the proper supplies.
                        Walt tells Skyler he's going to a sweat lodge but instead heads to Jesse's house. He congratulates Jesse for scoring the supplies, though a key chemical is missing. Jesse knows thieves who can steal it, but they want ten grand. Walt suggests he and Jesse pinch it themselves.
                        Meanwhile, Skyler heads to a jewelry store to return a baby-sized diamond tiara Marie gave at her baby shower. When she approaches the owner with the gift she is apprehended and informed it was stolen. Faking labor pains, Skyler avoids arrest and confronts Marie, who is evasive.
                        Walt and Jesse pull off their heist and cook in Jesse's basement. At an auto junkyard, Walt delivers the new meth to Tuco, who is ecstatic about the results. When one of Tuco's henchmen presumes to speak for him, Tuco viciously beats the guy to a pulp. Walt and Jesse look on in shock. Finishing up, Tuco laughs and tells Walt he'll see him next week ("A No-Rough-Stuff-Type Deal"). </p>

                    <p class="text-justify text-white">In an abandoned auto junkyard, Tuco Salamanca buys meth from Jesse Pinkman and Walter White, and then kills his henchman No-Doze for speaking out of turn. Jesse purchases a gun to protect himself from Tuco, but Walt proposes they kill Tuco with poison instead. Hank Schrader sends Walt a cell phone photo of No-Doze and Gonzo, Tuco's other associate, dead in the junkyard. Shortly afterwards, Tuco abducts Walt and Jesse at gunpoint ("Seven Thirty-Seven").
                        Hank briefs his DEA team about a raid on Tuco's headquarters, and then takes a leave of absence to search for Walt. Marie Schrader tells Skyler White that Walt might have a second cell phone and suggests Hank visit Jesse's mother. Diane Pinkman tells Hank about Jesse's low-rider car, which Hank tracks to Tuco's place using LoJack.
                        Trapped in a desert hideaway, Walt and Jesse try to slip Tuco the poison, but his ailing uncle, Hector Salamanca, tips Tuco off. Jesse and Walt escape and are hiding nearby when Hank approaches Tuco and kills him in a shootout ("Grilled").
                        To cover for their disappearance, Walt fakes amnesia and is hospitalized while Jesse removes meth evidence from his house, persuades Badger's cousin, Clovis, to tow away the RV, and gets himself arrested. Hank, interrogating Jesse, accuses him of working with Tuco, but releases Jesse when Tio refuses to ID him. Walt returns home where Skyler quizzes him about the second phone ("Bit by a Dead Bee").
                        A broke Jesse asks Walt for half their remaining money, but Walt refuses. Jesse's parents, aware of the meth lab, force him to vacate his house. He breaks into Clovis's repair yard and sleeps in the RV, stealing it back after Clovis threatens to sell the cooking supplies. Walt eventually shares some of his remaining cash with Jesse. Meanwhile, a suspicious Skyler keeps her distance from Walt and smokes to relieve tension ("Down").
                        Walt confronts Skyler about the cigarettes. "This is so unlike you," he says. "How would you know?" she retorts. Jesse rents a duplex apartment from Jane Margolis (who lives next door), and assembles a meth-dealing crew with his longtime friends, Badger, Skinny Pete and Combo. All goes well until a junkie couple robs Skinny Pete.
                        Meanwhile, at the DEA headquarters, Hank informs his boss about the mysterious blue meth being sold on the streets, and they begin an investigation about the supposed dealer who is selling the product, a man named "Heisenberg." Walt visits Jesse and demands retribution for their dealer being robbed ("Breakage").
                        Jesse, lying in wait for the junkies, discovers a small boy at their house. The junkies return some meth and promise Jesse the proceeds of a stolen ATM, but the woman knocks Jesse out. After Spooge, the male junkie, taunts his woman, she crushes his head with the ATM. Jesse grabs some cash, calls 911 and hurries the boy out of the house.
                        Skyler, meanwhile, thanks a bewildered Gretchen Schwartz for funding Walt's chemo; Walt begs Gretchen not to admit the truth. Gretchen calls Skyler to say they're cutting the money off, so Walt tells Skyler that Elliott Schwartz is broke ("Peekaboo").
                        The news of Spooge's murder make people on the streets believe that Jesse was the one who killed Spooge with the ATM. Walt uses this as an advantage to expand their territory, now that people actually fear crossing "Heisenberg's" path.
                        Skyler returns to Beneke Fabricators, her former employer, where her boss Ted Beneke once flirted with her. Skyler assures Marie the incident won't recur, but the two later share an intimate moment when Skyler opens up about Walt's cancer.
                        Hank gets promoted to work part-time in the DEA's El Paso office, but suffers anxiety attacks over his encounter with Tuco. His anxiety hits new highs during a stakeout in Mexico when a tortoise bearing the head of an informant explodes, maiming several DEA agents. Walt eventually councils Hank to face his fears, and Hank returns to work. Back at the duplex, Jesse and Jane develop a romance ("Negro y Azul").
                        After an undercover cop busts Badger, Walt and Jesse hire a shady attorney named Saul Goodman. Hank tells Badger he'll go free if he identifies "Heisenberg," so Saul arranges for an ex-con to take the fall for Walt.
                        Jesse suggests he and Jane share a joint, but she tells him she's been sober for 18 months. Jane later treats Jesse brusquely in front of Donald Margolis, her dad, causing Jesse to feel demoralized until she slips him a sketch of a superheroine named "Apology Girl" ("Better Call Saul").
                        Walt, awaiting test results he's certain will be discouraging, tricks Jesse into participating in a meth-cooking marathon. It's successful, but several mishaps leave the RV disabled and the two men stranded without water in the desert heat. Walt cobbles together a working battery and they return to Albuquerque, where Walt is surprised to learn his cancer is in remission ("4 Days Out").
                        Skyler hosts a party to celebrate Walt's good news. Hank and Walt nearly come to blows after Walt pours Walter Jr. tequila shots. After apologizing for his behavior at the party, Walt consumes himself with home improvements ("Over").
                        Combo is shot and killed. Spooked by Combo's death, Skinny Pete quits dealing and Jesse gets heavy into drugs with Jane, who introduces him to heroin.
                        Later, Saul offers to put Walt and Jesse in touch with a low-profile narcotics distributor who will buy their product in bulk, but this person will never meet with Walt and Jesse if he doesn't think he can trust them. Due to Jesse being under effects of heroin, he scares the distributor off by arriving high for a meeting. Walt persists, and Gustavo Fring finally reveals himself to Walt, giving him an hour to deliver his meth.
                        Skyler meanwhile discovers accounting irregularities at Beneke. Ted admits to fraud, but Skyler makes the choice to stay anyway — just before going into labor. Walt, rushing to retrieve the meth from his partner, finds Jesse passed-out at his apartment after using heroin with Jane once again. Walt is forced to steal the meth from Jesse to sell it himself, being forced to ignore Skyler's calls and missing his daughter's birth ("Mandala").
                        Jesse calls Walt, freaked that their meth has been stolen. When Jesse figures out the truth, Walt says he'll hold Jesse's $480,000 share until he's clean. Saul figures out a way to launder Walt's take through SaveWalterWhite.com, the website Walter White Jr. establishes to raise money for his dad's surgery.
                        Jane, who has promised her father Donald she'll enter rehab the next day, blackmails Walt for Jesse's money. Walt turns it over, but a coincidental bar chat with Donald inspires him to return to Jesse's apartment, where he watches as a drugged-up Jane chokes to death on her own vomit ("Phoenix").
                        The next morning, Jesse calls Walt, who arranges for an operative to remove drug evidence from Jesse's apartment. "I killed her," Jesse later sobs. Walt checks Jesse into rehab.
                        Before undergoing surgery, Walt while on an anesthetic unwittingly reveals to Skyler that he has a second phone. His surgery is successful, but a few weeks later Skyler leaves him. Donald returns to work as an air-traffic controller. Distracted by thoughts of his daughter, he inadvertently causes two planes to collide in the sky over Walt's house ("ABQ").

                    <p class="text-justify text-white">
                        Shortly after the Wayfarer Flight 515 disaster, two Juárez Cartel killers known as The Cousins slip into New Mexico after killing an entire clandestine convoy to avenge the death of their cousin, Tuco Salamanca. Their target: "Heisenberg."
                        Walter is forced to move to an apartment and comes clean about manufacturing meth to Skyler White, who promises not to divulge his criminal activities if he grants her a divorce and keeps his distance. Jesse Pinkman, meanwhile, emerges from rehab changed by Jane Margolis's death. "I'm the bad guy," he tells Walt, who has quite a different self-image: "I am not a criminal," Walt tells Gustavo Fring, declining the businessman's offer of $3 million to cook meth for three months ("No Más").
                        Using help from Saul Goodman, Jesse manages to buy his house back from his parents, who paid several hundred dollars to reform the house. The Cousins meet with their uncle, Hector Salamanca, to get information about Tuco's killer. At the same time, Saul hires Mike Ehrmantraut to bug the White Family residence to find out if Skyler told anyone about Walt's secret.
                        Walt defies Skyler and breaks into his own home to move back in. When the Cousins come calling, Mike, who just finished bugging Walt's house, spots their arrival and alerts Gus. The Cousins are called for a meeting and they let Walt (who is totally unaware of everything) live another day ("Caballo Sin Nombre").
                        Meanwhile, Skyler calls the police to oust Walt but can't bring herself to incriminate him. Since she can't get Walt out of the house, she retaliates by sleeping with her boss, Ted Beneke. Gus calls a meeting with the Cousins and their cartel boss, Juan Bolsa, who agrees to postpone vengeance until Gus ties up his business with Walt ("I.F.T.").
                        Upon learning that Jesse is cooking on his own, Gus purchases meth from Jesse and gives half the money due to Jesse to Walt to compel him back into the business. When Walt resurfaces to return the money, Gus unveils a state-of-the-art superlab he's constructed beneath an industrial laundromat.
                        Hank Schrader pursues the "Heisenberg" investigation despite being reassigned to El Paso, but a break in the case complicates matters. Short of cash on his way back from a cook, Jesse barters meth for gas. Hank finds a security camera tape that caught the RV at the gas station, he believes the RV is used as a mobile lab and starts a new investigation ("Green Light").
                        Walt rebuffs Gus again, lamenting the loss of his family. "A man provides," Gus lectures, "even when he's not appreciated, or respected, or even loved." Convinced, Walt begins cooking alongside Gale Boetticher, a fastidious assistant installed by Gus, and then moves back out of the house. Meanwhile, Hank connects Jesse to the RV, and the RV to Jesse's deceased longtime friend, Combo, a small time drug dealer who was killed while selling Blue Sky Meth ("Más").
                        When Hank calls Walt asking if Jesse had an RV, Walt arranges to have the vehicle demolished at a junkyard. Badger tips off Jesse, who races to stop Walt, and, unbeknownst to him, Hank follows.
                        While Walt and Jesse huddle inside the RV, Saul's secretary, impersonating a police officer, tells Hank that Marie Schrader's been in an accident. Hank leaves the junkyard, and by time he realizes he's been fooled, the RV is destroyed. Gus meets with the Cousins in the desert, revealing that Tuco's killer is actually the DEA agent Hank Schrader, he then gives the two hitmen permission to kill Hank: "May his death satisfy you" ("Sunset").
                        Hank, infuriated by the fact that Jesse supposedly knows who his wife is, brutally attacks Jesse in retaliation and gets suspended from the DEA. In the hospital, Jesse plots legal action against Hank. To placate Jesse, Walt convinces Gus to fire Gale and hire Jesse instead.
                        Later, an anonymous caller warns Hank about an imminent attack. Hank spots the Cousins. In the ensuing clash, Hank is shot multiple times but manages to kill one cousin and gravely injure the other ("One Minute").
                        To Walt's horror, Gus makes an appearance at the hospital where Hank is being treated. While consoling Marie, Gus recalls meeting Hank at the DEA and seeing the donation jar for Walt's surgery. Gus then tells Walt privately, "I investigate everyone with whom I do business." As Gus departs, the surviving Cousin flat-lines. Amid the commotion, Mike discards a syringe and slips away. In Mexico, Federales attack Bolsa's compound and gun down the Cartel boss ("I See You").
                        Walt requests a meeting with Gus to postulate that he was the Cousins' real target and that Gus protected him as part of an effort to undermine the cartel. Walt leaves with a $15 million meth production deal and a guarantee of his family's safety.
                        Walt's negotiations coincide with Jesse's increasing dissatisfaction with Gus's operation. Yearning to return to his "outlaw" days, Jesse skims excess meth at the superlab. Badger and Skinny Pete attend Jesse's NA sessions, where they hype the "blue stuff" as a sales tactic.
                        Hank's injuries leave him paralyzed. After Marie learns that their insurance won't meet Hank's needs, she gets unexpected help from Skyler who offers to cover their bills using money that Skyler claims Walt won "gambling illegally." After this, Skyler tells Walt to do what is right for the family, because she believes Walt is to blame for what hapenned to Hank ("Kafkaesque").
                        At the superlab, a housefly so obsesses Walt that he stops production. Weary from lack of sleep and sedatives that Jesse has slipped in his coffee, Walt describes the night Jane overdosed as the "perfect moment" for his own death. Walt also reveals his chance meeting with Jane's father ("Fly").
                        Skyler stakes out a more active role in Walt's criminal life, citing the need to ensure that the money for Hank's treatment is "unimpeachable." At her first meeting with Saul, the two squabble over money laundering schemes. Alone with Walt, she proposes they purchase the car wash where Walt used to work. She will handle the accounting. Jesse hypes the blue meth to a recovering addict named Andrea and discovers that two rival dealers directed her pre-teen brother to kill Jesse's friend, Combo ("Abiquiú").
                        Jesse wants to poison the dealers to avenge Combo, but him and Walt discover that the dealers actually work for Gus. Jesse wants to kill them anyway, despite Walt's warnings.
                        Mike visits Walt, he explains how Jesse is compromising the operation and warns Walt that if anything goes south, he is not going to hesitate in "taking a full measure." Walt, fearing for Jesse's life, tips off Gus who forces Jesse to make peace on the condition the dealers no longer use children in their operation.
                        Later that evening, police discover the murdered body of Andrea's brother.
                        Jesse drives to the rival dealers' corner. Just as Jesse and the dealers draw their guns, Walt runs over the dealers with his 2004 Pontiac Aztek. One dies on impact and Walt shoots the other dead. Walt tells Jesse to run ("Half Measures").
                        Walt's intervention infuriates Gus, who reinstates Gale as Walt's assistant while he hunts down Jesse. Walt meets secretly with Jesse to explain his suspicion that Gus plans to kill them once Gale learns to cook the Blue Sky Meth. Walt reasons that he has leverage only if he alone can produce their special formula. They must kill Gale. "I can't do it, Mr. White," says Jesse, who rathers turning to the police than killing at cold blood someone who is totally unaware of what's hapenning.
                        Walt agrees to kill Gale himself, but before he can act, Mike and Victor escort him to the superlab for an execution. Appearing desperate, Walt offers to give Jesse up, but says he moves around, so he'll need to call him. "They've got me at the laundry, and they're going to kill me," Walt tells Jesse over the phone. "Do it now!" Mike and Victor draw guns. "You might want to hold off," Walt says defiantly. "Your boss is going to need me."
                        Jesse arrives at Gale's apartment and draws his gun. "You don't have to do this," Gale pleads. Jesse, his eyes tearing, pulls the trigger, the screen fades to black ("Full Measure").

                        Story
                        In a flashback, Gale Boetticher takes notes on the construction of the new superlab. He praises the blue meth sample Gustavo Fring gave him to the point where he talks himself out of a job, saying that the person who cooked the sample deserves it better; Gale just talked Gus into hiring Walter White.
                        Back to the present, Jesse Pinkman shoots Gale at the doorstep of his apartment and flees. Victor arrives right after and finds a shell-shocked Jesse in the parking lot and returns him to the superlab at gunpoint. Victor admits to Mike Ehrmantraut that Gale's neighbors saw him at the scene, but insists it's not a problem.
                        Walt and Jesse wait, helplessly, for Gus to arrive. When he does, Walt tries to talk his way out of what he's sure must be a death sentence. Gus seems unmoved... but then slices Victor's throat with a box cutter, killing him. Then he coldly orders Walt and Jesse back to work.
                        Later, at Gale's apartment, police process evidence that includes Gale's lab notes ("Box Cutter").
                        Free, but feeling the looming threat of Gus, Walt purchases a gun for protection. Reeling from Gale's murder, Jesse calls Badger and Skinny Pete to throw a raging party at his house to numb himself. Meanwhile, Skyler White tries to negotiate the purchase of the car wash Walt once worked at from Bogdan Wolynetz, who refuses because of a grudge against Walt.
                        Walt urges Mike to help him kill Gus, but Mike lays him out in response: no go. Skyler begs Walt to seek police protection; Walt refuses ("Thirty-Eight Snub").
                        Hank Schrader, frustrated by his slow recovery, snipes at Marie Schrader, who soothes herself by stealing knickknacks at open houses. After she's caught, Hank's detective friend, Tim Roberts, resolves the matter. Tim then, based on Hank's expertise, asks for his help in solving Gale's murder, leaving him a copy of the lab notes to examine, which eventually he does ("Open House").
                        Skyler manipulates Bogdan into selling the car wash, then invents a gambling-addiction story for she and Walt to present to their family in order to explain their ability to purchase it.
                        Walt discovers that Hank is looking into Gale's murder, and that he suspects Gale may be "Heisenberg." A strange note to a person named "W.W." is in the first page of the notebook with the lab notes, Hank jokingly accuses Walt of being the person, and Walt sarcastically responds to the joke. Hank also discloses that Gale's lab notes contain the blue meth formula, and that fingerprints were found at the murder scene.
                        Jesse shrugs off Walt's news about the fingerprints and barely reacts when a partygoer steals his money. His house has become less a party than a crack house; he's totally numb. Mike reports Jesse's reckless behavior to Gus and the next day drives Jesse into the desert ("Bullet Points").
                        Walt, frantic over Jesse's disappearance, storms into Los Pollos Hermanos to confront Gus, who's not there. Mike orders Walt to cook alone. Jesse complains of boredom as Mike retrieves stashes of cash at various blind drops. He then ends up foiling what looks like an attempted robbery. Jesse is unaware that Gus orchestrated the incident to see if Jesse is worth of working in their operation.
                        Hank withdraws from consulting on Gale's case citing his feeling of closure. At dinner, Walt, tipsy, can't stand hearing Hank give Gale all the credit. He speculates that Heisenberg remains at-large, reigniting Hank's interest ("Shotgun").
                        Juárez Cartel gunmen hijack a Los Pollos truck and leave behind a message: "Ready to talk?"
                        Skyler theorizes that Walt fears for his life and secretly wants to get caught. "I am not in danger," Walt snarls. "I am the danger." Scared for her family, she travels out of town to the Four Corners monument to try to decide whether to run or stay; reluctantly she decides to stay in New Mexico ("Cornered").
                        Walt talks to Saul Goodman about his options. Saul tells him if he needs to get out, he knows a guy who can "disappear" him and his family. Walt asks about hiring a hit man to kill Gus, but Saul points out that Jesse already has access. Walt convinces Jesse that Gus must die and prepares ricin to poison him.
                        Jesse returns to his NA meeting and confesses to killing a "problem dog" -- Gale. When the group leader refuses to judge him, he taunts him saying he'd only gone to meetings to sell the members meth.
                        At the factory farm, Jesse passes up an opportunity to murder Gus. Gus has other problems, facing a cartel representative named Gaff. Gus offers $50 million to cease business relations. Gaff rejects it: "this is not a negotiation," he says.
                        Hank presents a startling hypothesis to DEA colleague Steven Gomez and ASAC George Merkert: Gus Fring, community leader, is a major meth distributor. They balk at the evidence Hank presents until he drops the bomb: Gus's fingerprints were found in Gale's apartment ("Problem Dog").
                        A quick flashback reveals that in the night where the Cousins died, Gus visited Hector Salamanca at the nursing home, Tio refuses to look at Gus' face. Gus reveals to him that he orchestrated the death of the Cousins, as well as the death of Juan Bolsa, leaving Tio with no allies.
                        In the present, Gus deftly handles joint questioning by the Albuquerque police and the DEA about Gale, though Hank unnerves Gus by asking about his Chilean background. The DEA buys Gus' story and lets him off clean. Hank, however, isn't satisfied.
                        Hank asks Walt to drive him to Los Pollos Hermanos and reiterates his theory about Gus before coaxing Walt to plant a GPS on Gus's car. Walt anxiously admits Hank's plan to Gus, who seems unfazed and tells him to go through with it.
                        Gus removes the GPS before visiting Hector Salamanca at a nursing home again. While there, Gus's memory drifts back to another flashback, at Mexico in 1989, when Gus and Max Arciniega, his best friend and first business partner in the meth trade, pitched their product at the hacienda of cartel boss Don Eladio Vuente. Don Eladio, infuriated by their presumption, orders his henchman, Tio, to kill Max at cold blood and forces Gus to watch. Tio later mocks Gus, telling him to stick with the fast-food business. Back to the present, Gus approaches Tio and orders him to look at him in the eyes, Tio refuses once again, Gus smiles and walks away: "Maybe another time," he mocks ("Hermanos").
                        Walt warns Mike that Hank has discovered the factory farm and plans to stake it out. Jesse and some of Mike's henchmen remove evidence of meth distribution from the location before Hank can get there, but afterward a cartel sniper (Gaff) opens fire on them and shoots one of Mike's men. Gus strides out into the sniper fire, defiant, but that night, calls the cartel: he'll give them what they want.
                        The IRS audits Beneke Fabricators. As Ted Beneke's former bookkeeper, Skyler, fears that her finances could come under scrutiny, so she plays dumb and convinces the agent that Ted's mistakes are all innocent. All Ted needs to do is pay back taxes and penalties; unfortunately, he's broke. Out of the frying pan...
                        Gus asks Jesse if he can cook Walt's formula. Jesse accuses Gus of planning to murder Walt. Gus replies that he needs Jesse's help to prevent war with the cartel.
                        Jesse calls Walt to come to his house and begs him to coach him on using his meth formula for the cartel chemists. Walt accuses Jesse of switching his allegiance and never intending to kill Gus. Walt then reveals that he's been keeping tabs on Jesse, and tells him he hopes Jesse ends up dead in the Mexican desert. Jesse explodes and they have a knock-down drag-out fight. In the end, Jesse kicks Walt out and tells him never to come back ("Bug").
                        Gus, Jesse and Mike travel to Mexico. They arrive at the cartel's superlab and Jesse faces down the lead chemist and cooks a high-quality batch. Back in Albuquerque, Skyler -- through Saul -- provides Ted money to cover his IRS debt, but Ted still refuses to settle his debt.
                        Walter White Jr. received a car as birthday gift from Walt and Skyler, but his father was not there when he received his gift, so Jr. decides to drive to Walt's apartment. Jr. finds Walt broken and scarred from the beating he took from Jesse, Walt apologizes to Jr. about every single bad thing he has done during the past year. After cleaning himself up, Walt tells Jr. that he doesn't want him to remember his father the way he was, but Jr. responds that Walt is acting weird since he found out about the cancer, at least this time he was being real.
                        Meanwhile in Mexico, the cartel reunites everyone at Don Eladio's mansion (the same place where Max was murdered), Gus and Don Eladio meet each other for the first time since their encounter in 1989. Gus offers a gift of tequila laced with poison. Don Eladio and his entourage drink it and collapse into death. Jesse helps Mike evacuate Gus, who drank the tequila to fool Don Eladio and, despite inducing vomiting, is feeling the effects of the poison. In the escape, Mike is shot and Jesse kills the shooter ("Salud").
                        Gus recovers at a state-of-the-art, though makeshift, medical facility that he set up in advance of their trip. Since Mike is in no conditions of travelling because of his gun wound, he has to stay behind and recover as Gus and Jesse continue their travel. Back in Albuquerque, Gus gloats to Tio that the cartel is destroyed and that Jesse shot Tio's grandson, thus ending the Salamanca family line. He finally has his vengeance for Max's death.
                        Hank asks Walt to drive him to the industrial laundry, he believes that the superlab from Gale's notebook is located there. Fearing exposure, Walt deliberately causes an accident, laying Hank up for awhile. He's bought some time, but Hank's not deterred.
                        Saul sends his men to force Ted to pay his IRS tab. Trying to escape, Ted cracks his head on a kitchen counter, badly injuring him. While cooking in the superlab, Walt notices that someone already cooked a batch, meaning that Jesse already returned to Albuquerque, but Walt wasn't informed.
                        Walt goes to Jesse's house, knowing that now that Gus found someone able to cook the Blue Sky Meth, Gus is going to kill him. Jesse's ex-girlfriend, Andrea Cantillo and her son Brock Cantillo are there when Walt comes to beg for help. Jesse rejects him, saying that the last time he asked for Walt's help, Walt hoped for him to end up dead in the mexican desert.
                        Walt is kicked out of Jesse's house, and right after, Gus's operative Tyrus Kitt tasers Walt and transports him to the desert, where Gus fires him. After Walt mocks Gus's failed attempts to turn Jesse against him, Gus threatens Walt's family: he's going to kill Hank, and if Walt interferes, he and his entire family will die. With no value left to Gus, Walt thinks he's a dead man.
                        Walt rushes to Saul's to get in touch with the "disappearer." Saul agrees to warn the DEA about the danger to Hank. Walt then learns that Skyler gave Ted most of their money to pay his taxes, leaving them without enough to pay the "disappearer." With Hank alerted, Gus will now know Walt talked, and set his sights on killing Walt and his family ("Crawl Space").
                        The DEA provides protection for Hank, Marie, and Walt's family at the Schrader home though Walt refuses to stay there himself. Walt heads off to figure out what to do. He spins a gun in his back yard, possibly thinking of killing himself. In the end, he gets an idea and heads out.
                        Brock is hospitalized for a flulike ailment. After discovering his ricin cigarette (that was intended to be used on Gus) is missing, Jesse tells Andrea to alert the doctors about a possible poisoning, and goes to confront Walt. He accuses Walt at gunpoint of poisoning Brock to get his revenge, but Walt convinces Jesse that Gus framed him: he claims Gus is using Jesse as the perfect assassin to kill Walt. Walt and Jesse conspire a plan to eliminate Gus.
                        In the next day, Jesse refuses to leave the hospital where Brock is, Gus is forced to go there and assure Jesse that everything is fine. Meanwhile, Walt planted a bomb on Gus' car. When Gus is leaving the hospital, he senses something amiss and abandons his car at the parking structure; Walt's masterplan to eliminate Gus failed ("End Times").
                        Walt and Jesse need to reformulate their plan to eliminate Gus until the end of the day, but two detectives suspicious about Jesse's ricin theory drag him away for questioning. Saul visits Jesse at the station and passes Walt a message from Jesse about Gus's visits to Tio. Walt deduces that the men are enemies and persuades Tio to entrap Gus.
                        At home under protection of the DEA, Hank is still suspicious about the industrial laundry, when his partner, Gomez, arrives and informs him that an informant with highly important information about the Blue Sky Meth wants to talk to Hank personally at the DEA headquarters. Hank decides to check it out; the informant is Tio, but instead of giving the information, he merely insults and taunts Hank.
                        Tyrus, who is keeping track of Tio, notices that he visited the DEA, meaning that he ratted out about something. Gus is informed, and claims that he is going to eliminate Tio himself; the time for the final act of his plan to avenge Max is finally here.
                        The police release Jesse after Brock tests negative for ricin. Outside the station, two men kidnap Jesse and force him to cook at the super-lab again, handcuffed and with a gun virtually to his head.
                        Gustavo Face Off Gif
                        Gus visits Tio for the last time at the nursing home, he calls Tio a "crippled rata" for talking to the DEA. As Gus prepares to administer a fatal injection, Tio looks Gus in the eyes for the first time in many years. Gus is shocked by this unexpected act, right after, Tio detonates a bomb Walt installed under his wheelchair. Gus, Tio, and Tyrus are blown to pieces.
                        At the superlab, Walt arrives and kills Jesse's captors. He and Jesse torch the lab, leaving no more evidences behind. Later, Jesse tells Walt that the common plant Lily of the Valley poisoned Brock, not ricin. "But still, he had to go, right?" asks Jesse of Gus. "You're damn right," Walt replies. They shake hands, and Jesse returns to the hospital to be with Brock and Andrea.
                        Walt calls Skyler; she's seen the news about the explosion and wants to know what happened. "I won," he says, simply. Walt drives out of the parking structure past Gus' deserted car with a smirk in his face.
                        In the final shot of the season, a flowering plant sits poolside at Walt's house. The camera closes in and the tag reveals its name: Lily of the Valley ("Face Off"). </p>

                    <h1 class="title text-danger">Season 5</h1>
                    <p class="text-justify text-white">One year into the future, Walter White sits alone at a restaurant with his head full of hair and beard grown, he meets with Lawson, his former gun dealer, who gives him a key to a car in exchange of some money. Walt takes a pill and leaves the restaurant, approaching the car and revealing that he just bought a M60 machine gun that's hidden in the car's trunk.
                        Back to the present, Walt returns home after finally killing Gustavo Fring, he disposes of anything linking him to his successful plot against Gus and then hides the ricin he stole from Jesse Pinkman inside his bedroom, but the laptop containing security footage of Walt is held by the police. Walt calls Jesse and Mike Ehrmantraut to setup a mission to help him destroy the laptop using an industrial electromagnet, but in the process of doing so, the police end up discovering a secret bank account held by Gus that was used to pay his employees. Back home, Walt tries to forgive Skyler White, but the damage has already been done: She's afraid of him. ("Live Free or Die")
                        Because Skyler used the money Walt earned from Gus' operation to pay off Ted Beneke's IRS debt, Walt believes he has no choice but to start cooking meth again to earn back the money he lost. Walt and Jesse try to convince Mike to join them, but he refuses, stating that Walt is a "time-bomb." Meanwhile, the police discovered that a Madrigal Electromotive GmbH executive, Peter Schuler, was working with Gus in the meth business and was one of the many people being paid by the discovered bank account. Peter commits suicide before the German police are able to reach him.
                        Worried about this situation, Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, another one of Gus' contact working for Madrigal, tries to contact Mike. She offers to pay him to eliminate the eleven men from the bank account before the police reach them too, but Mike refuses. Lydia then tries to get Mike killed, but fails. Mike decides to use Lydia to help Walt and Jesse in their newly founded Drug Empire. ("Madrigal")
                        Walt, Jesse and Mike begin a three-way partnership to distribute meth again, while not fully trusting Lydia. Their plans for meth manufacturing are almost not succesful because Saul Goodman cannot locate satisfactory sites, save for one — a pest control company known as Vamonos Pest. Walt and Jesse use the business's fumigation tents on random houses as a mobile laboratory: after the tents are positioned on a house, Jesse and Walt use a mobile meth lab inside the house to produce their product. Skyler realizes that Walter is not exactly free from his meth-making past and begins to fear for her and her children's lives because of the danger involved. Meanwhile, Walt is worried that Jesse forming a new family with Andrea Cantillo will intervene in their new operation, so he manipulates Jesse into breaking up with her. Walt and Mike get into a heated argument when Walt finds out that Mike is planning to use nearly half of their money from distribution to pay off the nine employees from the bank account that are now all in prison. ("Hazard Pay")
                        Hank Schrader is promoted to become the new ASAC for the DEA in Albuquerque for his work in discovering Gus' drug empire. He decides to start a new investigation on the nine employees imprisoned, knowing that there are still more people connected to Gus. The Schraders later reunite with the Whites for Walt's birthday party, where Skyler tries to commit suicide by walking into the pool. After being saved, she asks Marie Schrader to take care of her children. After the Schrader's leave, Skyler reveals to Walter that, with no other options, she is just patiently waiting for his cancer to come back.
                        Meanwhile, the methylamine flow is disrupted because Lydia found a GPS tracker stuck to the bottom of one of the barrels, forcing Walter, Jesse, and Mike to think of another option to keep the meth production. Walt decides that the methylamine will keep flowing no matter what: They are just beginning. ("Fifty-One")
                        Mike kidnaps Lydia, planning to kill her if she doesn't reveal that the GPS in the barrel was her plan to be set free from the operation, but they end up discovering that she was not lying, the DEA planted the tracker. Lydia offers Walt another option to obtain methylamine: rob a train carrying a large shipment. The heist is nearly compromised when a child spots them, but he is shot by a new hire for the heist, Todd Alquist. ("Dead Freight")
                        As the DEA begins to track Mike, and with the recent death of the child, both Jesse and Mike design a permanent exit for themselves from the business. They plan to sell their methylamine for $5 million each to Declan, a major regional meth producer and distributor. Walt derails Jesse and Mike's scheme when he refuses to sell his share of the methylamine, forcing Mike to lock up Walt until the deal is done. Walt is able to escape and takes the methylamine with him, he later gives Mike and Jesse another option to earn money with the production like he wants and at the same time Mike and Jesse can leave the business, "everybody wins." ("Buyout")
                        Walt uses his Heisenberg persona's infamy to cut a distribution deal with Declan and negotiate the $5 million severance for Mike. Jesse is determined to leave the business, irrespective of his financial cut, so Walter enlists Todd as his assistant cook. After the DEA closes in on Mike, he decides to leave for good.
                        Walt meets with Mike in the desert so they can set things up before Mike departs New Mexico. Walt says that there is one last thing that he requires from Mike: the name of Gus' nine employees that might talk in prison, but Mike refuses to give them, blaming Walt for all the bad things that happened until now. Walter impulsively shoots Mike dead after a confrontation, later regretting the action when he remembers that Lydia has the names. ("Say My Name")
                        After getting rid of Mike's body, Walt manages to get the names from Lydia and arranges for the men to be killed by associates of Todd's uncle, Jack Welker, leader of a white supremacist gang.
                        In exchange for her safety, Lydia arranges for Walt's product to be shipped to the Czech Republic using Madrigal's more obscure branches. Over the next few months, this nets Walt an extraordinary amount of money - so much that, after some pleading from Skyler, he finally decides to retire, dropping off $5 million he owed to Jesse at his door. Months later, the White family is happily living under one roof again.
                        All seems to be going well until one day during a barbecue with the Whites and the Schraders, Hank excuses himself to the toilet and while searching for something to keep himself distracted, he discovers a book of Walt Whitman poetry dedicated to "WW" by "GB". Hank, remembering a conversation with Walt regarding the initials from his earlier investigation and surmising that "GB" is Gale Boetticher, clearly sees that Walter is Heisenberg.
